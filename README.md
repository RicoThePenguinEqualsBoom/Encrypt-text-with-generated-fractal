This is a partially finished(but mostly unfinished) project to generate a random fractal using the given text as a modifier and store the text with the lSB method after having been encrypted. <br>
<br>
As my other projects, this has been developed as a learning experience to a point I deemed worthy of basic utility(not useful just operationnaly adequate) and will be put on "hold"/the backburner until I aquire enough experience to bring 
warranted improvements.<br>
And as my other projects, feel free to critique, take, modify and make your own however you'd like.
